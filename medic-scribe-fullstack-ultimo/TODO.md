## Notes

- **Priority Levels**: High priority items address core functionality, security, and performance. Medium priority items improve user experience. Lower priority items add advanced features and operational improvements.

- **Effort Estimates**: Most items are designed to be completed within 1-2 sprint cycles (2-4 weeks each).

- **Dependencies**: Items 1-3 should be completed before major feature additions. Item 2 (audit logging) is critical for medical compliance.

- **Success Metrics**: 
  - Test coverage >80%
  - API response times <2 seconds
  - Mobile usability score >90%
  - Zero data security incidents
