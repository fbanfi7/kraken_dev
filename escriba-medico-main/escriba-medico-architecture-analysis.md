### Medical Transcription Workflow

1. **Authentication & Setup**
   - Doctor authenticates via Supabase Auth
   - Selects note type from predefined templates
   - Obtains patient consent

2. **Audio Capture & Processing**
   - Records consultation using WebRTC/RecordRTC
   - Processes audio in chunks to prevent memory issues
   - Maintains wake lock during recording

3. **AI Processing Pipeline**
   - Audio sent to Supabase Edge Function [`transcribe-audio`](frontend/supabase/functions/transcribe-audio/index.ts)
   - Forwarded to Kraken Analytics API endpoint
   - Deepgram performs speech-to-text transcription
   - OpenAI generates structured SOAP notes using custom prompts

4. **Data Management**
   - Doctor reviews and edits generated notes
   - Patient selection/creation workflow
   - Saves to PostgreSQL with proper relationships

## Database Schema Analysis

### Core Tables

```sql
-- Medical professionals
medico (id, user_id, nombre, email, especialidad)

-- Patients
paciente (id, user_id, nombre, documento, sexo, cobertura, numero_telefono)

-- Doctor-Patient relationships
medico_paciente (id, medico_id, paciente_id, fecha_primera_consulta)

-- SOAP Notes
nota_soap (id, medico_paciente_id, contenido, tipo_nota_id, editado, firmado, fecha_creacion)

-- Note Types with custom prompts
tipo_nota (id, descripcion, prompt)
```

### Key Relationships
- Many-to-many relationship between doctors and patients
- SOAP notes linked to specific doctor-patient relationships
- Note types support custom AI prompts for different consultation types
