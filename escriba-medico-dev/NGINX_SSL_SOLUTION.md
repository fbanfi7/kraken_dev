# Nginx SSL Configuration Solution

## Problem Overview

The deployment was failing during the SSL certificate request phase due to a mismatch in how Nginx configurations were structured and mounted in the Docker containers. Specifically:

1. The Nginx configuration was being mounted at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (the main configuration file)
2. However, certbot and standard Nginx practices expect site configurations to be in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`
3. This mismatch caused the SSL certificate request to fail

## Solution Implemented

We've restructured the Nginx configuration to follow standard practices:

### 1. Updated Docker Compose Configuration

In `compose.prod.yml`, we changed how the Nginx configuration is mounted:

```yaml
volumes:
  # Mount the site-specific config at the standard location
  - ./nginx/generated_nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
  # Add a base nginx.conf that includes conf.d/*.conf
  - ./nginx/base_nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
```

### 2. Created a Standard Base Nginx Configuration

We created `nginx/base_nginx.conf` that follows the standard Nginx structure:
- Sets up basic Nginx parameters
- Includes configurations from the `conf.d` directory

### 3. Updated Nginx Templates

We modified all Nginx template files to be site configurations rather than complete Nginx configurations:
- Removed the `events` and `http` blocks (these are now in the base config)
- Kept only the `server` blocks and related directives
- Added clear comments about where these files will be placed

### 4. Updated Validation Script

We updated the validation script to test the configurations correctly:
- Creates a test environment with both the base nginx.conf and the site configuration
- Validates them together as they would be used in production

## Deployment Process

The deployment now follows this process:

1. The `deploy.sh` script generates a temporary Nginx configuration for SSL validation
2. This configuration is mounted at `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`
3. The base configuration at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` includes this site configuration
4. Certbot can now properly validate the domain and issue certificates
5. After obtaining certificates, the final Nginx configuration is generated and deployed

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Standard Structure**: Follows Nginx best practices for configuration organization
2. **Better Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with certbot and other tools that expect standard Nginx configuration paths
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Separates the base Nginx settings from site-specific configurations
4. **More Robust**: Reduces the chance of configuration errors and deployment failures

## Testing and Verification

To verify the solution:
1. Run the validation script: `./scripts/validate_nginx.sh yourdomain.com`
2. Deploy with the updated configuration: `./scripts/deploy.sh yourdomain.com your-email@example.com`
3. Check that SSL certificates are properly obtained and the site is accessible via HTTPS
