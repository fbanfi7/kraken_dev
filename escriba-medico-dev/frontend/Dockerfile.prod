# Install Bun and dependencies
# Using Bun for faster installation
RUN npm install -g bun
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Build the production-ready static files
# The output will be in the /app/dist directory
RUN bun run build

# Stage 2: Create a minimal image for serving content (for inspection if needed)
# This stage is not strictly necessary for the final build but can be useful
# for debugging the build output. The primary output is the /app/dist
# directory from the 'builder' stage, which will be copied by Docker Compose.
